A deep learning model to predict stock prices using LSTM

# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** â€” a type of deep learning model â€” to predict stock prices based on historical data.

---

## Project Overview

- Predict future stock prices from past trends
- Uses LSTM, ideal for time-series data
- Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository  
2. Open it using **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**  
3. Run the cells step-by-step  
4. Upload your stock data (CSV) or use sample data  
5. View prediction results and graphs

---

## Output

- Graphs showing real vs. predicted stock prices  
- Final LSTM model predictions for future values

---

## Possible Improvements

- Add support for multiple stocks  
- Integrate with a real-time stock API  
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is an academic-level project meant for learning and demonstration  
- For better accuracy, hyperparameter tuning and more data can be added
